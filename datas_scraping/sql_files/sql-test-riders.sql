Achieving accolades as Rookie of the Year on his debut with Monster Yamaha Tech 3 in the premier class, Crutchlow then made his first podiums and pole positions with the Yamaha banner before leaving to the Ducati Team in 2014. Switching to LCR Honda the year after, Crutchlow’s greatest glory came in 2016 as he took victory in the wet in Brno – the first British winner for 35 years – and then followed it by another win at Phillip Island, in the dry. Top Independent Team rider in 2016 and a podium finisher once again in 2017, Crutchlow remained with the LCR team in 2018 for the fourth year running, winning another Grand Prix and on to challenge for the title of top Independent Team rider once again until his season was curtailed by injury. Crutchlow returned from a near career-ending injury by claiming P3 on the opening night of 2019, with two more podiums coming the Briton’s way. 2020 saw Crutchlow continue with LCR Honda Castrol, though an eighth-place finish was the best he had to offer before deciding to hang up his leathers. The Brit then rejoined the Yamaha ranks as a test rider for the 2021 season, and later replaced injured Franco Morbidelli at Petronas Yamaha SRT for the Styrian and Austrian GPs. Ahead of the British GP, with Maverick Viñales seperating from Yamaha, Crutchlow links up with the factory team alongside Fabio Quartararo.'),

Born in Yamanashi, his credits include winning the J-GP2 title in the All Japan Road Race Championship in 2012, a second place finish in the Suzuka 8 Hours in 2016, and a season in the FIM Supersport World Championship in 2017. Watanabe also has a handful of starts in the intermediate class of Grand Prix racing, in both the 250cc and Moto2™ eras, and was Team Suzuki Ecstar’s choice to fill in for Joan Mir in the MotoGP™ when the Spaniard was ruled out of the 2022 San Marino Grand Prix due to injury.'), 
     ('10', 'Luca', 'Marini', '1997-08-10', 'Italy', '184', '69', 'Luca Marini, half brother of Valentino Rossi, cut his teeth racing in the Italian CIV series, ending the 2013 CIV Moto3™ championship in fourth with six podium finishes. He moved to the Spanish CEV Moto3™ series in 2014, before in 2015 he moved to the Moto2™ European Championship with the Paginas Amarillas HP 40 Junior team, taking second in just his third race. A run of aggressive rides saw him finish the year in fifth overall, and he was a regular top five contender. 2016 saw the Italian make his full time World Championship debut with the Forward Racing team alongside fellow Italian and VR46 Academy rider Lorenzo Baldassarri, where he remained for 2017. A move to Sky Racing Team VR46 for the 2018 season saw Marini string together his best year yet - claiming five podium finishes, including a maiden Grand Prix win in Sepang. Starting the season as a title favourite, Marini’s winter shoulder surgery would mean he had a difficult opening to the year. However, P2 at Mugello kick-started the Italian’s campaign, with two victories coming his way in Thailand and Japan. Marini was once again among the favourites for the Moto2™ crown in 2020 with SKY Racing Team VR46, and he lived up to the tag as he lead the chasing pack for much of the Championship. However, a nasty crash in the French GP Qualifying took its toll on the Italian as he finished P17, losing his title lead in the process. Despite battling through the injury and securing P2 in Portimao, Marini couldn’t reach the summit again and finished second in the Championship. As one of the most promising youngsters in the sport, he made the jump up to the premier class and partnered the man who edged him to the title, Enea Bastianini, at Esponsorama Racing in 2021. The young Italian found it tough at first, his big frame not suited to modern MotoGP™, but he cracked it late in 2021. A front-row start at home in Misano and a top five finish in Austria are likely to give him a boost heading into 2022 with the new VR46 Racing squad.'),

For 2014 he began to focus on the Red Bull Rookies Cup, ending the year in eighth with a best finish of second at Brno. In 2015 he emerged as a title contender, taking two wins and four second place finishes to end the year in second. This saw him quickly snapped up by the Gresini team, racing the final 2015 round for them in Valencia before joining the team full time in 2016. After fighting to be Rookie of the Year and taking three podiums, Di Giannantonio stayed with Del Conca Gresini Racing Team Moto3™ for 2017 and took five podiums to take P5 overall. He remained with the outfit in 2018, and managed to secure second in the lightweight class Championship after claiming his first two Grand Prix race wins. A step up to the Moto2™ class with Speed Up Racing was the Italian’s next chapter, and it was an impressive year. Six top tens, coupled with two podiums in Brno and Misano, saw Di Giannantonio claim P9 overall and the Moto2™ Rookie of the Year. Chasing a first intermediate class victory in 2020, the Italian could only muster two podium finishes while he cruelly crashed out in the Valencia GP as he searched for that elusive victory. 2021 was a year of change as Di Giannantonio moved to Federal Oil Gresini Moto2 and a Kalex bike. Better fortunes came his way as he clinched that all-important Grand Prix win in Jerez. Three other podiums were enough to earn the Italian a dream move to MotoGP™ in 2022.

He showed great speed during the 2014 Rookies season with three wins, two seconds and a third. Many expected him to be a title contender during the 2015 FIM CEV Repsol Moto3™ Junior World Championship, and he ended the season in fourth taking some incredible wins - and in with a fighting chance of the title until the final round of the year. He also made his Grand Prix debut that year at the Australian GP, replacing the injured Hiroko Ono, and impressed many with his pace. He moved up to the World Championship with Leopard Racing aboard a KTM in 2016 and was Rookie of the Year, taking his first victory at the Austrian GP. For 2017, Mir remained with Leopard Racing to fight for the title, but this time on a Honda - and took a stunning ten wins on the way to wrapping up the crown at Phillip Island, at the same venue where he made his debut only two years before. The Mallorcan moved up to Moto2™ with EG 0,0 Marc VDS to partner Alex Marquez in 2018 and took podiums on the way to being crowned Rookie of the Year; good preparation for a quick graduation to the premier class with Team Suzuki Ecstar. His maiden MotoGP™ year was impressive and his latter season form after a monster Brno testing crash was superb. 10 top 10s and a best finish of P5 in Australia was a sign of things to come from the Mallorcan, as 2020 became the year of Mir. It wasn’t the most auspicious of starts from the Suzuki rider, as he retired twice in the first three races of the season, but following the Czech GP, he became a model of consistency. Four podiums in the next five launched his title bid, and while all those around him were faltering, Mir kept producing the goods to take the Championship lead with podiums in the Aragon double, meaning his fate was in his own hands. Then the highlight of the year, his maiden victory came following a commanding performance in the European Grand Prix, all but securing the title with two races to go. As the grid returned for the Valencia GP the following week, Mir’s seventh place finish meant he followed in the footsteps of fellow Mallorcan Jorge Lorenzo in becoming a MotoGP™ World Champion. He was unable to defend the crown in 2021, though, with Suzuki''s GSX-RR falling slightly behind the development curve throughout the season. Mir did secure third in the standings thanks to six podium finishes, but a winless and title-less year will no doubt act as huge motivation heading into 2022.'),

Taking the 125 IDM crown on his way to full time competition on the world stage, Miller first impressed in 2013 when he proved a consistent frontrunner with Racing Team Germany. A title challenge with Red Bull KTM Ajo in 2014 saw Miller just miss out to Alex Marquez, before he made the incredible move from Moto3™ straight to MotoGP™ in 2015. After a tough rookie season, Miller took a stunning maiden win in 2016 at the TT Circuit Assen, despite a season that began with a broken leg and was then subsequently interrupted by more injury. Taking a good number of top ten results, Miller remained with the Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS team for 2017 and impressed once more before moving to Pramac for 2018 and switching from Honda to Ducati machinery. More consistent and taking his first pole position, it was a solid season for the Australian who remained with Pramac Racing in 2019 and on GP19, Miller was super impressive. Five podiums came the number 43’s way in and he continued to show his class throughout 2020, earning another four podium finishes, though that first win in Ducati colours still escaped him. A move to the factory squad was deserved and he delivered in 2021: two victories, three further podiums and fourth in the World Championship. Miller''s form dipped at times during 2021, so he''ll have to be more consistent if he''s to fight for the crown in 2022.'),

He won four races in his rookie year – third in the Championship and Rookie of the Year – and then took that title in 2013. As a Moto2™ rookie in 2014, Viñales was again Rookie of the Year and won four races – moving up to MotoGP™ the year after with Team Suzuki Ecstar. Another Rookie of the Year trophy followed, before the Spaniard then took Suzuki’s first race win since 2007 – and his maiden MotoGP™ win – at the British GP in 2016. For 2017, Viñales moved to Movistar Yamaha MotoGP to partner none other than Italian legend Valentino Rossi. After dominating pre-season testing, the Yamaha rider won the first two races of the year and the French GP, but the Movistar Yamaha team’s struggles with low grip then saw a more difficult latter half of the season. Viñales came third overall, and the struggles continued into 2018. It was the Spaniard who brought Yamaha''s longest losing streak to an end, however, as he won in Australia. 2019 started slowly for Viñales, picking up just the solitary podium in the first seven races. However, victory at Assen then put the wheels in motion for a fantastic latter half of the season. Five podiums, including a win in Malaysia, saw Viñales claim P3 in the Championship. 2020 brought hopes of a title attack for Viñales, and he was in contention from the very beginning thanks to successive second places in the Jerez double, while victory at the Emilia Romagna GP bolstered his hopes. However, inconsistent form and an inability to follow up on promising Qualifying sessions saw the Spaniard slip out of the title race and finish 6th in the Championship. 2021, his fifth year at Yamaha, started in remarkable fashion with victory at the opening round. But the relationship deteriorated from there in unprecedented circumstances. 24 hours on from a podium in Assen, it was announced he''d leave Yamaha at the end of the season, one year earlier than planned, but he didn''t even make it to Valencia. After over-revving his engine in Austria, Yamaha sacked the Spaniard with immediate effect. Rumours began to grow that he''d sign for Aprilia and, before long, that deal was announced and he was testing the RS-GP in Misano. The Noale factory handed him the final five rounds of the year to adapt to the new machine and prepare for a hugely important 2022 campaign alongside Aleix Espargaro.'),

By 2016 he was third overall in the Rookies with two wins and six podiums, took a win in the Moto3™ Junior World Championship and made his Grand Prix debut with a P11 finish. 2017 was a more difficult year in the FIM CEV Repsol despite Fernandez taking pole position in Portugal, but in 2018 the Spaniard bounced back in style to accrue three wins and six podiums on the way to winning the FIM CEV Repsol Moto3™ Junior World Championship. He also made four more Grand Prix appearances as a mixture of wildcards and replacement rides; Catalunya, Germany, Aragon and Valencia saw him take two top tens and score points in three of the four Grands Prix he contested. In 2019, Fernandez moved into the Moto3™ World Championship full time in the same Angel Nieto Team structure with whom he won the CEV title, and proved a quick learner as he was a regular Top 10 finisher. 2020 proved to be his breakout year, with stunning Qualifying times meaning he was a regular sight on pole position. A first podium in Aragon was followed up by a maiden victory in the European GP, while he earned another podium and victory in the season-ending Valencia and Portimao GPs respectively. Fernandez well and truly declared himself as the hottest prospect in MotoGP™ in 2021 as he enjoyed the most successful rookie campaign in Moto2™ history. An incredible eight victories, bettering Marc Marquez''s previous record for rookie wins, saw him play his part in a stunning title duel against teammate Remy Gardner. However, a crash with three rounds to go in Misano all but ended his charge, eventually having to settle for runner-up. Fernandez will make his MotoGP™ debut in 2022 with Tech3 KTM Factory Racing alongside Gardner. '),

Top “Open” rider the year after, and on the podium at MotorLand Aragon, Espargaro then joined the factory Suzuki team in 2015, hauling more points and a pole position at the Catalan GP. In 2017, Espargaro moved to Aprilia Racing Team Gresini and took some top results for the Noale factory, including a best of sixth in both Qatar and Aragon. Progressively cutting the gap to the front, Espargaro remained with Aprilia in 2018 but it was off to a tough start before they made some big progress in the latter half of the year. Remaining with the team in 2019, Espargaro earned a best result of P7 on an unfavoured RS-GP, a result he couldn’t quite match during 2020, as despite being a consistent Top 10 challenger, he finished 17th overall in the Championship. He continued for a fifth season with Aprilia in 2021 and his hard work was rewarded with a much-improved RS-GP. He later became the Noale squad''s history-maker by taking their debut MotoGP™ podium in Silverstone. Can Espargaro back that up with further rostrums throughout 2022?'),

In 2010 he was invited by Honda Australia to represent them in the NS100F International Trophy and took part in the premier MRRDA Nippers Championship for riders under 13. The following year he left Australia to settle in Spain, where he competed in the Mediterranean Championship. From 2013 he rode in the FIM CEV Repsol with the Calvo/LaGlisse team. In 2015 Gardner joined the CIP Team with a Mahindra bike and moved to Moto2™ in 2016, ending the year with Tasca Racing. In 2017 the Australian moved to Tech 3 Racing in the intermediate class, with whom he remained with for 2018. Gardner''s season was heavily hampered after a training accident left him with two broken legs, with a best finish of fifth coming in Valencia. A move to the SAG Team came in 2019, there was a podium and four Top 6 appearances, but he couldn’t find the consistency to challenge regularly. 2020 saw his fortunes improve with three podiums preceding a maiden race win in the Portimao finale. That victory was the perfect springboard into the Red Bull KTM Ajo team, and the Australian was able to unravel a stunning year. Five wins, six P2s and one P3 was enough to see Gardner fend off rookie sensation teammate Raul Fernandez to claim the intermediate class title.

The Spaniard then moved up to MotoGP™ in 2006 and took two wins in his rookie year, including his fourth ever race in the class. A consistent frontrunner and title challenger, including taking the most wins in MotoGP™ in 2012, Pedrosa’s career has been plagued by some injuries – but the Sabadell native won at least one Grand Prix in every season of his career since 2002. In 2014, Pedrosa suffered problems with arm pump and early the following season underwent major, career-saving surgery. Finishing the year on a high with two spectacular wins once back to full strength, the Spaniard also won in Misano in 2016 after a tough season. Breaking his collarbone in Motegi, the 3-time World Champion was back to full strength for 2017 and kept his incredible record of at least one win a year rolling, taking victory in Jerez and Valencia. 2018 would prove the Spaniard''s final season as a MotoGP™ racer, as he called it a day after failing to register a win or podium finish all year. Having ended his long association with Honda, Pedrosa soon signed a deal with KTM to take on the role of test driver and has proved instrumental in the Austrian manufacturer’s dramatic rise towards the top table of motorcycle racing.

His first victory came at Donington in 2009 when riding for Repsol Honda, before the Italian moved to the Ducati Team following a stint with Monster Yamaha Tech 3. A key part of Ducati’s journey back to the top, ‘DesmoDovi’ is one of the hardest to overtake on the brakes – and one of the cleanest competitors in battle. After long seasons of hard work saw the bike more and more competitive and a consistent frontrunner, 2017 saw the Italian challenge for the World Championship down to the wire in Valencia after a stunning six wins across the season. For 2018, he hit the ground running to win the season opener, endured some harder races and then came back swinging - ending the year runner up once again. 2019 began in similar fashion: a win in Qatar. However, a certain Marquez turned up the wick and proved too much for everyone, with Dovizioso claiming nine podiums - including two wins - on his way to P2 in the overall standings for a third year in a row. Many fancied Dovi for the title during 2020, particularly in the absence of the injured Marc Marquez, however, there was to be no dream send off from Ducati for the Italian, who could only earn one victory during the season, at the Austrian GP, soon after announcing he was to leave the Bologna Bullets. He ended the season 4th in the standings and announced his intention to take a sabbatical from the sport. It was short-lived though, as before the start of the 2021 campaign, Aprilia announced he would test their new RS-GP in Jerez over three days in April. After completing some tests with Aprilia, Dovizioso was called up to step in at Petronas Yamaha SRT for the final five races of 2021, with Dovizioso signing a one-year contract to ride a factory YZR-M1 next season.

After a tough start, the rider from Cervera went on an incredible winning spree and had closed the gap to Championship leader Stefan Bradl to a handful of points, before a crash in practice for the Malaysian GP saw Marquez forced to cede the fight and miss the two remaining races of the year. Problems with his vision in the off season saw surgery then finally fix the problem, and despite the shortened preparation for 2012 the Spaniard took the crown in stunning style by the Australian GP. Replacing outgoing Casey Stoner in 2013 at the Repsol Honda Team, Marquez won his second ever MotoGP™ race and incredibly took the Championship in his rookie year. Then beginning 2014 with 10 wins in a row, Marquez won that crown in Motegi to successfully defend the title. Before 2015 proved more difficult with some mistakes and too many DNFs. Losing out to Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi, Marquez began 2016 with a point to prove and took another incredible Championship title – redesigning his mentality and thinking about the long game as he put consistency at the top of the agenda. The reigning Champion then fought down to the wire against Andrea Dovizioso for the 2017 crown, with everything going down to the final round and Marquez - despite an incredible moment into Turn 1 - keeping it on the podium to break another record and take another title. He began 2018 as the reigning Champion once more and went on to make more history, taking nine wins and wrapping up the title in Japan - becoming the youngest ever seven-time World Champion. 2019 saw the number 93 take yet another step up, fighting off Dovizioso once more, as well as new rivals in Alex Rins and Fabio Quartararo, with a series of tough last lap battles. After a season of only finishing second or better in every race - bar a DNF at the Circuit of the Americas - the Repsol Honda rider went on to make it Magic Number 8, needing just 15 rounds, getting the job done in Thailand. Any hopes of another record breaking year were put on hold in 2020 however, as Marquez sustained an injury to his right humerus in the season opener in Jerez, which eventually ruled him out of the season. Thankfully, Marquez was able to return to action at Round 3 in Portimao in 2021. Slowly but surely, the number 93 regained speed and fitness and at the Sachsenring, he was back on the top step. A P2 in Aragon was followed by back-to-back victories in Austin and Misano, signalling Marquez was returning to some real form. However, a training accident caused the return of diplopia (double vision) that he suffered with in 2011.

Bradl experienced a difficult start to the season, only managing to finish in the points twice in the first nine races, with a best-placed finish of eighth at the Catalan GP. After nine races, Bradl was released from his contract at Forward Racing and took on a new challenge by joining the Factory Aprilia Racing Team Gresini for the second half of the season. Bradl would stay with Aprilia in 2016 as they brought in an all new prototype machine, but a seventh in Argentina was his best result as the German finished his final full-time MotoGP™ racing season in 16th.

For the 2019 season he signed with CIP Green Power, adding his second podium in Argentina in a somewhat controversial year. For 2020 he was confident of being able to rub shoulders with the usual race leaders and did so, taking victory at the Catalan GP and a 2nd position at the Aragon GP. Binder started 2021 in fine form, with podiums at the Qatar and Doha Grands Prix. Despite being unable to take any further rostrums, fighting at the sharp end on a regular basis caught the eye of WithU Yamaha RNF management. So much so, the South African will be the second man in history to make the move from Moto3™ to MotoGP™. It''s a life-changing move for Binder, can he repay the trust put him in by Yamaha in 2022?'),

Unfortunately it was a season plagued by various injuries, but the following year he tried again and finished runner-up behind the 2013 champion Karel Hanika. In 2014 he dominated the same Championship and took the crown. For 2015 Martín took the next step and participated in his first full season in the Moto3™ World Championship, where he joined the Mahindra Mapfre Aspar team. An awesome seventh in Aragon helped the Spaniard to finish the year 17th overall, with he and the Aspar team electing to continue their relationship for 2016. For 2017, the Spaniard moved to Del Conca Gresini Racing Moto3 to replace outgoing title contender Enea Bastianini. The master of qualifying and on pole for half the entire season, Martin took an impressive nine podiums despite a mid-season injury, and his maiden win in the season finale on the way to P4 overall. His stellar year would arrive in 2018 as Martin beat Marco Bezzecchi to the Moto3™ crown, claiming seven victories despite picking up another mid-season injury. Red Bull KTM Ajo in Moto2™ became the Spaniards home in 2019, and he rewarded his new team with podium finishes in Japan and Austria toward the tail end of the season. A title charge awaited in 2020, a Spanish GP podium followed up with a victory and podium finish in the Spielberg double, he was right in the Championship mix. However, a positive Covid-19 test meant he missed the Misano double, and successive retirements put to bed any plans of the Championship. There were three more podiums in the final five Grand Prix, including victory in Valencia, which helped him secure fifth place in the standings. 2021 brought a move up to MotoGP™ with Pramac Racing on a GP21, and it''s safe to say Martin hit the ground running. A debut pole and podium were secured in Doha before a huge crash in Portimao saw him break eight bones. Missing four races, Martin returned and after the summer break, in Austria, a first victory was his. Two more podiums helped Martin secure the Rookie of the Year crown, and in 2022, the Spaniard is being tipped for greatness. '),

The Italian spent four seasons away, during which time he finished fifth in the WSS series in 2010, before he joined the Moto2™ World Championship with the experienced Gresini team full time in 2011. He finished the season with an emotional win at the last round of the year in Valencia, an instrumental point in the team’s decision to continue racing following the loss of their much-beloved rider in the premier class, Marco Simoncelli. Pirro was at the helm of the Gresini Team’s MotoGP™ CRT project, riding their FTR MGP12 Honda bike for his first taste of the premier class. After a year with Gresini he joined Ducati as a test rider and made a number of wildcard appearances as well as being the main replacement rider. In 2016 he filled in for the injured Danilo Petrucci in the Octo Pramac Yakhnich squad aboard the GP15. Remaining with the Borgo Panigale factory as a test rider, Pirro wildcarded once more at Mugello in 2017 and took a stunning second row start, backing up his pace in the race with a top ten finish. In 2018 there were more wildcard appearances in Misano, Sepang and Valencia, with a P4 in the latter seeing him narrowly miss out on a podium. There were three more on-track appearances for Pirro in 2019, once again at Mugello, Misano and Valencia, before standing in for the injured Francesco Bagnaia at the Austrian double in 2020.

He was reconfirmed for the Monlau Competicion team for 2012 and won another race before the step up to the World Championship, where he partnered Roman Fenati in the Team Italia FMI in 2013. For 2014 he switched teams as well as machinery as he lined up for the Sky Racing Team VR46 on a KTM, and 2015 brought another new challenge with the new Aspar Team Mahindra. Ending the year as the top Mahindra rider, the Italian was also frequently involved in the podium battle, retaining his seat for 2016 and going on to take not only a maiden win in Assen, but also a second win in Sepang. Earning a test ride on the team’s MotoGP™ machine in Valencia at the end of the season, Bagnaia moved up to Moto2™ in 2017 with the new Sky Racing Team VR46 intermediate class effort and was Rookie of the Year, taking several podiums. In 2018 he hit the ground running and was a contender for the crown from the off, with some incredible wins and consistency seeing him eventually take the title in Malaysia. Impressive in his first outings in the premier class in testing, Bagnaia moved up to MotoGP™ with Pramac Racing in 2019. It was a difficult rookie year for Bagnaia but a fantastic P4 in Australia showed plenty signs of promise. 2020 proved a mixed year for the Italian and his GP-20. He earned an impressive second place in the San Marino GP and a week later at the same track, he was on the verge of a maiden premier class victory until a heartbreaking slide off the track ended his hopes. He never quite got going again in the remaining races but 2021 brought renewed hope for Pecco in the factory squad. Three podiums and a pole at the opening four rounds signalled the Italian as a title contender and, despite a blip in the middle of the season, he finished the year as the form man of the Championship. A debut MotoGP™ win came at Aragon after an incredible head-to-head with Marc Marquez, and he backed it up with victory in Misano a week after. His title charge slipped through his fingers with a crash during our second visit to Misano, but victory at the final two rounds of the year has the Italian as one of the huge favourites for the 2022 crown.'),

He did not participate in the first race of the Championship, as he was five days below the minimum age to compete. Yet in the second race, held at Albacete, he achieved 11th place. That year he finished 11th in the final standings with 24 points. In 2011 he then came very close finishing the season top, but just missed out to older rival Alex Rins. 2012 proved to be his year, as he won the Moto3™ CEV title, and took part in numerous wildcard rides in the Moto3™ World Championship including an incredible performance at the Catalan GP. For the 2013 season he stepped up full time with the Estrella Galicia 0,0 team and secured his first victory at Motegi, coming fourth overall. In 2014, Marquez won more races and took more podiums on the way to taking the Moto3™ World Championship. Marquez then moved up to Moto2™ with the EG0,0 Marc VDS team for 2015 and had a tough rookie year with two top four finishes, looking to expand on the potential he showed the following year as rider and team remained together in 2016. He started the season with an arm injury, but then took his first podium finish with a stunning ride at MotorLand Aragon to come home P2 after a last corner duel. Taking his first intermediate class win after proving unstoppable on home turf at Jerez, Marquez followed it up with another win at home in the Catalan GP. Then injured mid-season and taking some time to recover fully, the rider from Cervera was unable to fight for the title but took fourth overall, after another victory at Motegi in a tactical masterpiece. In 2018, Marquez was able to claim six podium finishes, but he went the year without a win. Remaining with the team for another year, 2019 saw Marquez step up to the plate. Five victories and another five podiums saw him claim his second World Championship with a race to spare, and following Jorge Lorenzo’s retirement from MotoGP™, the then Moto2™ World Champion stepped into the Repsol Honda colours to partner his brother Marc for 2020. While it was a year to forget for the older Marquez brother, Alex made hay as he claimed back-to-back second places in the French and Aragon GPs. He narrowly missed out on the Rookie of the Year award, coming 14th overall in his maiden year. 2021 saw him remain with Honda, but in the LCR Honda Castrol ranks under the guidance of Lucio Cecchinello. A struggling Honda package saw Marquez struggle to find any real form, but P4 at the Algarve GP was a reminder of the speed Marquez possesses.

Savadori was born in Cesena, Italy in 1993, and it wasn’t long before he was swinging his leg over a bike for the first time. Introduced to racing by his father, the youngster took a standard apprenticeship in junior disciplines before being picked for the inaugural edition of the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup in 2007. He immediately impressed onboard the standard KTM 125cc bike used in the youth initiative, taking victory in the opening race of the competition at Jerez. He finished runner-up in the 2007 series. Following that success, Savadori made an assault on the Italian national 125cc crown in 2008. The standout rider in the class, he took the title in what was a busy year. In the summer he had competed in the European Championship event at Albacete, winning the 125cc race and adding to his impressive CV. 2008 also saw him make his debut in the World Championship with an Aprilia as a wildcard entrant. He competed at Mugello, Misano and Valencia, and was snapped up for a first full season in the 125cc class in 2009 by Fontana Racing. He only finished 4 out of the 13 races he started but Savadori did manage an impressive 9th place finish in Mugello. Then the Italian rode with Matteoni C.P. Racing, before he moved to the CIV STK Championship and the FIM STK1000 Cup in 2011. He stayed in STK1000 in 2012 and took his first win at Monza, coming fifth overall and repeating that in 2013. In 2014 he made a step forward and took second overall, before Savadori took the crown in 2015 after four wins and seven podiums. For 2016 he moved up to WorldSBK and has since been a regular threat for the top five and top ten, having some impressive pace. In 2019, he made the move to Energica Ego in the MotoE™ Championship, where again he launched regular assaults on the Top 10. Fast forward a year later and Aprilia handed him his chance in MotoGP™ at the European GP. His debut ended in disappointment though as he retired from the race, but he held onto the seat for the final two races of the season. 2021 saw him made a permanent rider for Aprilia.'),

After a more difficult 2014 affected slightly by injury, Rins moved to Moto2™ for 2015 and was Rookie of the Year, taking wins in his debut season in the intermediate class. A title challenger in 2016, the former national Champion finished the season in third after more impressive wins and podiums, and moved up to MotoGP™ in 2017 with Team Suzuki Ecstar. Despite some trouble with injury and missed races, Rins was impressive and took some top five results as a rookie – a good springboard for his sophomore season. He went on to take five podiums in 2018 and consistently fight at the front; another solid foundation for 2019. The next step was made in 2019 as Rins claimed a maiden MotoGP™ victory at the Americas GP, before repeating the feat in Silverstone. 2020 was another outstanding year for the Spaniard as he claimed victory in the Aragon GP as well as podium finishes in the Catalan, Teruel and European GPs, helping him claim 3rd overall in the Championship. 2021 was a year to forget for Rins, with crashes at crucial times costing him dearly.

He remained with the team in 2016 and took his first win in Assen at the Dutch GP, and by the end of 2017 had garnered eight podiums and two poles. For 2018 Nakagami graduated to the premier class to ride with LCR Honda Idemitsu, and was the best qualifying rookie with several appearances in Q2. 2019 saw Nakagami stay with LCR Honda Idemitsu on a 2018 RC213V, and the Japanese rider strung a solid season together, claiming nine Top 10s and a best finish of P5 at Mugello. Shoulder surgery ended Nakagami’s season after the Japanese GP. His fourth season in the premier class saw him improve even further, placing inside the Top 10 in every race with the exception of Teruel, where he earned a first pole position, and the Valencia GPs.

In 2015 he challenged for the title in the early stages of the year, taking his first victory on the world stage at home in Misano as well as five additional podiums.

For 2017, Bastianini changed to Estrella Galicia 0,0 and had a more difficult year, gaining traction in the latter stages and taking a pole and three podiums. For 2018 he replaced outgoing reigning Champion Joan Mir at Leopard Racing, finishing fourth in the Championship after six podium finishes, including one victory. 2020 saw Bastianini become a World Champion as he took the Moto2™ crown. A podium finish in Qatar helped him launch his title attack, but it really took flight after back to back victories in the Andalusian and Czech GPs before a victory and podium finish in Misano helped cement his place among the leading contenders. From there, Bastianini only once failed to break into the Top 6 places, including podiums in the Aragon double, and it was that consistency that saw him become a World Champion. 2021 brought a new challenge, and one he thrived in.

That year he also rode his first 125 GP, before competing in the Moto3™ World Championship full-time for the first time in 2012. His first podiums came in 2014, before a move to the Red Bull KTM Ajo squad for 2015 saw him add four more podiums. For 2016 he and the Ajo team remained together and took the Moto3™ title in stunning style, winning it in the Aragon GP. Binder moved to Moto2™ with the Red Bull KTM Ajo team in 2017, racing the new KTM chassis in the intermediate class, but found the first half of his season marred by an arm injury. Forced to be patient as he fought back to full strength, once he was there the South African ended the season with three podiums in a row. In 2018, Binder stayed with Red Bull KTM Ajo and managed to secure his first three Moto2™ victories, finishing third in the Championship. A troubled KTM chassis meant one of the title favourites had to wait until Round 8 for a 2019 rostrum, but Binder’s latter half of the season form was sensational, missing the podium just three times in 12 races, winning five – including the last three.

     ('21', 'Franco', 'Morbidelli', '1994-12-04', 'Italy', '176', '64', 'Born in Rome and now living in the motorsport-rich Tavullia, Franco Morbidelli took the Superstock 600 title in 2013 alongside World Championship wildcard outings in Moto2™ at Misano, Motegi and Valencia. He went on to sign with Italtrans Racing Team for a full campaign in 2014 and continued with them in 2015, making his podium debut in Indianapolis. Unfortunately a broken leg sustained during a motocross training session saw him miss several races after Brno, with Morbidelli returning to finish the season but far from fully fit. For 2016 he signed with the highly successful Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS team and took an incredible run of podium finishes, ending the year just outside the top three in the title fight after an impressive campaign. For 2017, Morbidelli stayed with EG0,0 Marc VDS and came out swinging to take the first three wins of the year - in the lead in the standings during the entire season and taking the title at the Malaysian GP...from STK600 to World Champion in four years. He moved into the premier class within the same EG 0,0 Marc VDS team in 2018 and took the Rookie of the Year honours. 2019 saw Morbidelli join Petronas Yamaha SRT, picking up a solid seven top six finishes. It got even better for the Italian as a masterclass in Misano saw him take a maiden MotoGP™ win, and he added two more in the Teruel and Valencia GPs for a joint best three race wins in 2020, with two more podium finishes seeing him leap to second in the Championship standings. That form saw him among the leading contenders for title glory in 2021, but a knee injury hampered his season. Returning to action at Misano, Morbidelli partnered Fabio Quartararo at Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP after gaining promotion from Petronas Yamaha SRT, and the Italian will be a factory Yamaha rider until at least the end of 2023.
